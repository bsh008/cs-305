Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
desires to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did fairly well at describing the hashing involved in encrypting communications.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful? I need more practice workign with them I was able to perform them but I need to see more in action to trully uinderstand them. 
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
THe more the better It seems like, I would use all of the techiniques i learned the past 8 weeks inlcuding encryption, updating APIs and utilizing Reestful applications. 
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? I tried runnign the code, there were no errors in syntax.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks? Having a mentor or co-programmer present would help. A more experienced onserver could give helpful guidance without doing the work for me. 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I wouldn't show this work I would feactor this several times before showcasing any of it.
